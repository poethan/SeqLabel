# SeqLabel
some projects of Sequence labelling tasks or papers, especially for Chinese language

with CRF++ (https://github.com/taku910/crfpp) toolkit:

\< A Study of Chinese Word Segmentation Based on the Characteristics of Chinese>

Chinese analysis and feature templates design

\< "Chinese Named Entity Recognition with Conditional Random Fields in the Light of Chinese Characteristics">

ps. For GBSSL (Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning) part, please contact Samuel (Xiaodong Zeng) of the co-author. Apply GBSSL to Chinese NER


European Languages:

\< "Detection of Verbal Multi-Word Expressions via Conditional Random Fields with Syntactic Dependency Features and Semantic Re-Ranking" >

=> projects: [https://github.com/alfredomg/ADAPT-MWE17] [https://github.com/poethan/ADAPT-MWE17], video: [https://youtu.be/knx8ycRV8G0], slides [http://alfredomg.com/data/uploads/docs/dclrs-presentation.pdf].

Apply CRF to a broad range of European languages, 15 languages, for sequence labeling. Semantic reranking for the CRF candidates outputs.
